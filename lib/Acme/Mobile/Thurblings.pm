=head1 NAME

Acme::Mobile::Thurblings - count keystrokes to write mobile text messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::Mobile::Thurblings;

  $thurbs = count_thurblings("See u l8r");

  # $thurbs == 23
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module counts the number of I<thurblings> used to write mobile
text messages.  A thurbling is unit used to measure the number of
actions (in this case keypresses or pauses) for people who like to
optimize industrial processes.

So you can use this module to determine useless facts such as that it
takes as many keypresses to write "later" or "great" as it does "l8r"
and "gr8".

I have no idea if a "thurbling" is a real unit of measurement or just
the figment of a former employer's imagination. (Internet searches for
the term were fruitless.) But since this is an Acme module, it doesn't
matter much.

The current version is case insensitive and assumes (by default) a
particular brand of Nokia phone. (I have no idea which model it is; it
was cheap, and it works, which is all I care about.)

A description of methods is below.

=item new

  $obj = Acme::Mobile::Thurblings->new();

This is used for the object-oriented interface. It is only useful if
you want to specify your own keypad or modify the rules:

  open $fh, 'mykeypad.yml';
  $obj = Acme::Mobile::Thurblings->new($fh, \%rules );

The rule file is in L<YAML|http://www.yaml.org> format that specifies
the characters for each key pressed (in the order that they occur for
each key press).

The optional rules allow one to change the behavior of the counting
function:

  $obj = Acme::Mobile::Thurblings->new($fh,
  {
    SAME_KEY         => 1,
    NO_SENTENCE_CAPS => 0,
  });

=over

=item SAME_KEY

The number of thurblings to count as waiting when having to enter
letters which require pressing the same key (as with the word "high").
Defaults to C<1>.

=item NO_SENTENCE_CAPS

By default the initial letter of the message and of each sentence is
assumed to be capitalized (when counting in case-sensitive mode). This
option disabled that.

=item count_thurblings

  $count = count_thurblings($message, $case_flag);

  $count = $obj->count_thurblings($message, $case_flag);

Returns the number of "thurblings" (keystrokes) used to generate the
message.  A thurbling is either a keystroke, or the pause when one has
to wait in order to enter multiple letters from the same key (such as
with the word "high").

The default number of thurblings for waiting in the same key is
C<1>. There is no way to change that value for this version.

When C<$case_flag> is true, the number of thurblings includes
keystrokes to toggle the shift key.  It assumes that the first letter
of the message or a sentence is capitalized.  (If C<$case_flag> is
unspecified, it is assumed to be false.)

NAME
    Acme::Mobile::Thurblings - count keystrokes to write mobile text
    messages

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Mobile::Thurblings;

      $thurbs = count_thurblings("See u l8r");

      # $thurbs == 23
  
DESCRIPTION
    This module counts the number of *thurblings* used to write mobile text
    messages. A thurbling is unit used to measure the number of actions (in
    this case keypresses or pauses) for people who like to optimize
    industrial processes.

    So you can use this module to determine useless facts such as that it
    takes as many keypresses to write "later" or "great" as it does "l8r"
    and "gr8".

    I have no idea if a "thurbling" is a real unit of measurement or just
    the figment of a former employer's imagination. (Internet searches for
    the term were fruitless.) But since this is an Acme module, it doesn't
    matter much.

    See the module POD for more details.
